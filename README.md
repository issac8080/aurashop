# AuraShop – AI-Powered Personalized Shopping Assistant

A full-stack, hackathon-ready prototype that delivers **real-time AI product recommendations** based on user behavior, preferences, browsing history, and intent. Built for e-commerce and omnichannel environments.

**Quick start:** Run the **backend first** (port 8000), then the frontend. If the backend is not running, the frontend still loads with fallback product data and shows a banner with the start command.

## ✨ Features

- **🔍 Smart Search** – Real-time product search across name, description, category, tags, and brand with dedicated search page.
- **🏪 In-Store Pickup with QR Code** – Customers can choose store pickup, receive unique QR code, and scan at store for instant verification and pickup.
- **👤 Profile & Order Management** – User profiles with order history, contact info, saved addresses, and order tracking.
- **📦 Order Tracking** – Real-time order status updates (Pending → Confirmed → Ready for Pickup/Out for Delivery → Picked Up/Delivered).
- **💰 Aura Wallet** – AuraPoints rewards system: earn 5-7% on every purchase, valid for 30 days, automatic credit after order completion.
- **🤖 Intelligent AI Assistant** – Enhanced chatbot with deep product knowledge, personalization, comparison capabilities, and contextual recommendations. Understands complex queries like "best phone under 30k" or "formal wear for interview".
- **✨ Beautiful Modern UI** – Stunning gradient hero with Unsplash backgrounds, glass-morphism effects, smooth animations, and premium design throughout.
- **🖼️ Unsplash Integration** – High-quality, category-specific images for all products and dynamic hero backgrounds.
- **🎯 AI Recommendation Engine** – Ranks products using user preferences, session behavior, cart contents, and budget signals (OpenAI + rule-based fallback).
- **💬 Enhanced Chat Experience** – Natural language queries, product suggestions, budget-aware alternatives, inline product cards, 6 suggested prompts, emoji support, and gradient UI.
- **📊 Session-based Tracking** – Page views, product clicks, search queries, cart add/remove, time spent, budget signals, category affinity.
- **🎨 Personalized UI** – "Recommended for You" and "Trending" carousels, AI badges (Best Match, Value for Money, Trending), top picks on product listing, "Why this product is right for you" and similar products on detail, upsell/cross-sell on cart.
- **📱 Fully Responsive** – Desktop and mobile optimized with Tailwind CSS, modern components, and smooth transitions.

```

## Setup

**Run the backend first.** The frontend proxies `/api/*` to `http://localhost:8000`. If nothing is listening on port 8000, you'll see connection errors until the backend is started. The frontend will still show products using fallback data and a "Backend not running" banner.

### 1. Backend (Python) — start this first

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
# source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
# requirements.txt includes chromadb + numpy for RAG (semantic product search + FAQ). Optional: works without them using keyword-only recommend and fallback FAQ.
copy .env.example .env   # Windows
# cp .env.example .env   # macOS/Linux
# Edit .env and set: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
```

Run the API:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

API base: `http://localhost:8000`. Docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### 2. Frontend (Next.js)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

App: `http://localhost:3000`. The app uses Next.js rewrites so `/api/*` is proxied to `http://localhost:8000/*`.

### 3. Environment

**Backend** (`backend/.env`):

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` – Your OpenAI API key (required for AI recommendations and chat).
- `CORS_ORIGINS` – Default `http://localhost:3000`.

No env vars are required in the frontend for the default setup.

## Deploy on Vercel

To fix **404 NOT_FOUND** on Vercel:

1. **Vercel Dashboard** → Your project → **Settings** → **General**.
2. Under **Root Directory** click **Edit**, enter **`frontend`**, then **Save**.
3. **Deployments** → **⋯** on the latest deployment → **Redeploy**.

The Next.js app lives in the `frontend/` folder. If Root Directory is left blank, Vercel builds from the repo root and returns 404. Full steps (including deploying the backend): see **[VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md](VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md)**.

## Troubleshooting

### `ECONNRESET` / "Failed to proxy http://localhost:8000/..."

The frontend proxies `/api/*` to the backend. This error means **the backend is not running** or the connection was reset.

**Fix:** Start the backend first in a separate terminal:

```bash
cd backend
.venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Keep this running, then use the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`. The app will show a "Backend not running" banner until the backend is up.

### "upstream image response failed" (503)

Product and hero images use **Picsum Photos** (no API key, reliable). If you see 503 from an image URL, it’s usually temporary; refresh the page. Unsplash Source was deprecated and is no longer used.
