## 💬 Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: How does the AI personalization work?**
A: "We track user behavior - what they view, search, add to cart - and use that context with OpenAI to generate personalized recommendations. The system learns preferences like budget range, favorite categories, and style."

**Q: Is the QR code secure?**
A: "Yes, each QR code is a SHA-256 hash unique to the order. It's verified against our database and can only be used once. In production, we'd add expiration and additional security layers."

**Q: Can this scale?**
A: "Absolutely. The architecture is modular - we can swap in-memory storage for PostgreSQL, add Redis for caching, and deploy on cloud infrastructure. The QR system is designed for high-volume retail."

**Q: What about mobile?**
A: "Fully responsive. The QR code is optimized for mobile display, easy to screenshot, and the entire app works seamlessly on phones and tablets."

**Q: How accurate are the recommendations?**
A: "We use OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini with carefully engineered prompts that include user context, browsing history, and product catalog. We also have rule-based fallbacks for reliability. In testing, recommendations are highly relevant."
